# Markov Model for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of HP Testing Strategies in Bleeding Peptic Ulcers
* This repository contains a Markov model designed for cost-effectiveness analysis of various Helicobacter pylori (HP) screening strategies in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. The model evaluates the effectiveness and cost associated with different diagnostic approaches, helping determine the most optimal strategy for identifying HP infection in this patient population.

## Screening Strategies Evaluated:
* Histology
* Rapid Urease Test
* Stool Antigen Test
* Urea Breath Test
* Serology (Immunoglobulin G)

## Purpose:
* The primary objective of this analysis is to assess which HP screening strategy provides the best balance between cost and effectiveness in identifying HP infection in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers.

## Model Details:
* Patient Population: The model assumes that patients enter the simulation at age 65 and are followed over a time horizon of 35 years.
* Costs associated with each diagnostic strategy, treatment options, and long-term management are integrated into the model to estimate the cost-effectiveness.
Health outcomes such as survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are used to measure the effectiveness of each screening strategy.

## Results:
* The results of the Markov model include an analysis of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each strategy.
* Sensitivity analysis is also included to assess the robustness of the results under various assumptions.
